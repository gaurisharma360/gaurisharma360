- 👋 Hi, I’m @gaurisharma360.
I am currently a pursuing my Masters in Data Science and AI, previously I did my Bachelors in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. As of now I have immense interest to do work in fields of health and security.
However I am still exploring the infinte possibilities the subject holds.
- 👀 I’m very passionate about solving difficult problems for I love challenges. Although I may not be able to solve all of them but still the knowledge I gain in the process, is what motivates me.
- 🌱 I’m currently polishing my knowledge about already known languages and exploring them in depth, for strong fundamentals help you in long run and then the pace with which I can implement possible projects can be much quicker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun and impactful.
